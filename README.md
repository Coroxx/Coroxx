### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web project named BeatUniverse, it's like reddit but for french music.. I am diversifying by publishing repositories especially in python such as TheSmartool and PegazManager

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Laravel so php and javascript.

- ðŸ“« You can add me on discord : Corox#0666, I would be glad to help you
